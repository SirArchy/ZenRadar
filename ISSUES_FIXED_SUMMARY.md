# Issues Fixed Summary

## 1. RangeSlider Assertion Error ✅

**Problem**: `'package:flutter/src/material/range_slider.dart': Failed assertion: line 170 pos 15: 'values.end >= min && values.end <= max': is not true.`

**Root Cause**: The price range values were not being properly validated against the dynamic min/max price bounds.

**Solution**: 
- Added safety clamping for RangeSlider values
- Implemented bounds checking before rendering
- Added logging to track price range adjustments
- Files modified: `lib/widgets/mobile_filter_modal.dart`

## 2. Google Sign-In Error Code 10 ⚠️

**Problem**: `PlatformException(sign_in_failed, com.google.android.gms.common.api.ApiException: 10: , null, null)`

**Root Cause**: Missing SHA-1 fingerprint configuration in Firebase Console.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced error handling with specific error code messages
- Added proper PlatformException import
- Created detailed setup guide with SHA-1 fingerprint instructions
- Files modified: `lib/services/auth_service.dart`, `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md`

**Action Required**: User needs to add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console (see GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md)

## 3. Recent Scans Showing 0 Products ✅

**Problem**: Recent activities displayed "0 products scanned" even though scans were processing correctly (407, 408+ products).

**Root Cause**: The preload service was using incorrect field names (`crawlResult.totalProducts` instead of `totalProducts`).

**Solution**: 
- Fixed field mapping in `_convertCrawlRequestToScanActivity`
- Aligned with the actual Firestore document structure
- Added proper status message handling
- Files modified: `lib/services/preload_service.dart`

## Testing Required

1. **RangeSlider**: Open filter menu - should no longer crash
2. **Recent Scans**: Check recent activities - should show correct product counts
3. **Google Sign-In**: Follow setup guide to add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console

## Next Steps

For Google Sign-In to work properly:
1. Run `cd android && .\gradlew signingReport` to get SHA-1
2. Add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console
3. Download updated google-services.json
4. Clean rebuild the app

All other issues should be resolved immediately.
