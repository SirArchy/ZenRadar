# Recent Scans Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Recent Scans feature that tracks and displays background and manual scan activities in ZenRadar.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Background Activity Screen (Recent Scans)
- **Location**: `lib/screens/background_activity_screen.dart`
- **Access**: History icon in the app bar of the home screen
- **Features**:
  - Shows all past scan activities with pagination
  - Displays scan statistics (today, this week, total)
  - Shows scan details: timestamp, items scanned, duration, stock updates
  - Supports pull-to-refresh and infinite scrolling
  - Color-coded scan types (Background, Manual, Favorites)
  - Clear old activities functionality

### 2. Scan Activity Model
- **Location**: `lib/models/scan_activity.dart`
- **Properties**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `timestamp`: When the scan occurred
  - `itemsScanned`: Number of products scanned
  - `duration`: How long the scan took (in seconds)
  - `hasStockUpdates`: Whether any stock changes were detected
  - `details`: Additional information about the scan
  - `scanType`: 'background', 'manual', or 'favorites'

### 3. Database Support
- **SQLite**: Added `scan_activities` table (version 6)
- **Web Storage**: In-memory storage for web compatibility
- **Methods**: Insert, retrieve, count, delete activities
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Option to clear old activities (30+ days)

### 4. Background Service Integration
- **Mobile**: Real background scanning with activity logging
- **Web**: Simulated background scanning for demonstration
- **Logging**: All scans (successful and failed) are recorded

### 5. Manual Scan Integration
- **Home Screen**: Manual scans now create scan activity records
- **Error Handling**: Failed scans are also logged with details
- **Stock Detection**: Records if any products are in stock

## Web Platform Enhancements

### Simulated Background Service
- **Location**: `lib/services/web_background_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Creates realistic scan activities every 2-5 minutes
  - Simulates different site combinations
  - Varies scan duration and item counts
  - Randomly includes stock updates

### Initialization
- **Location**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Process**: Web background service starts automatically on app launch
- **Demonstration**: Users can see how the Recent Scans feature works

## User Interface

### Recent Scans Screen Layout
1. **Statistics Cards**: Today, This Week, Total scans
2. **Activity List**: Chronological list of all scan activities
3. **Scan Details**: For each activity shows:
   - Scan type badge (color-coded)
   - Timestamp (relative: "2 hours ago")
   - Items scanned count
   - Duration formatted (e.g., "1m 23s")
   - Stock update indicator
   - Site details

### Color Coding
- **Background**: Green badge
- **Manual**: Blue badge  
- **Favorites**: Pink badge
- **Stock Updates**: Green checkmark or red X

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE scan_activities (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
  itemsScanned INTEGER NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
  hasStockUpdates INTEGER NOT NULL,
  details TEXT,
  scanType TEXT DEFAULT 'background'
)
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Pagination (20 items per page)
- Indexed timestamp for fast queries
- Automatic cleanup of old records
- Efficient scroll-based loading

## Usage

### Accessing Recent Scans
1. Open ZenRadar app
2. Tap the history icon (ðŸ“‹) in the top-right corner
3. View your scan activities and statistics

### Understanding the Data
- **Background scans**: Automatic scans performed by the app
- **Manual scans**: Scans triggered by user actions
- **Favorites scans**: Background scans focusing only on favorite products

## Cross-Platform Support
- **Mobile**: Real background scanning with notifications
- **Web**: Simulated scanning for demonstration purposes
- **Database**: Adaptive storage (SQLite on mobile, in-memory on web)

## Future Enhancements
- Export scan history to CSV
- Detailed scan analytics and charts
- Scan scheduling customization
- Performance metrics and trends
