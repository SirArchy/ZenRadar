# Test Plan for Fixed Issues

## Issue 1: Infinite Height Error in Product Detail Page
- **Problem**: BoxConstraints forces an infinite height error on line 374 in product_detail_page.dart
- **Fix**: Replaced `SizedBox.expand` with `AspectRatio` widget with 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Test**: 
  1. Open the app
  2. Navigate to any product 
  3. Tap on a product to open product detail page
  4. Verify the page opens without infinite height constraint errors

## Issue 2: Improved Notification Permission Handling
- **Problem**: Notification permission was being requested automatically on app start
- **Fix**: 
  1. Removed automatic permission request from main.dart
  2. Added dedicated `requestNotificationPermission()` method to NotificationService
  3. Updated onboarding screen to only request permission when user explicitly presses the button
  4. Added better visual feedback showing permission status
- **Test**:
  1. Fresh install or clear app data
  2. Go through onboarding screens
  3. On notification page, verify permission is NOT requested automatically
  4. Tap "Enable Notifications" button
  5. Verify permission dialog appears
  6. Check that button state updates to show success/failure
  7. Verify appropriate feedback message is shown

## Changes Made:

### product_detail_page.dart
- Line 374: Changed `SizedBox` with infinite height to `AspectRatio` with 16:9 ratio

### notification_service.dart

## Benefits:
