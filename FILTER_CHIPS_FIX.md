# 🎯 Filter Chips Logic Fix - Improved Stock Status Filtering

## Problem Solved
Fixed the filter chip logic so that the "All" filter chip only affects stock status and favorites filters, without clearing other filters like price range, sites, categories, etc.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced "All" Filter Chip Logic**
- **Before**: Only cleared `inStock` filter
- **After**: Clears both `inStock` and `favoritesOnly` filters
- **Preserves**: Price range, sites, categories, search term, and other modal filters

### **2. Improved Filter Chip Selection Logic**
- **All**: Shows both in-stock and out-of-stock items, including non-favorites
- **Favorites**: Shows only favorites (both in-stock and out-of-stock favorites)
- **In Stock**: Shows only in-stock items (clears favorites filter)
- **Out of Stock**: Shows only out-of-stock items (clears favorites filter)

## 🎯 **New Behavior**

### **Filter Chip Interactions**
```
All Filter Chip Selected:
├── Unselects: "Favorites", "In Stock", "Out of Stock"
├── Preserves: Price range, sites, categories, search
└── Shows: All products according to modal filters

Favorites Filter Chip Selected:
├── Unselects: "All", "In Stock", "Out of Stock"
├── Clears: inStock filter (shows both in/out of stock favorites)
├── Preserves: All other modal filters
└── Shows: Only favorite products (both in-stock and out-of-stock)

In Stock Filter Chip Selected:
├── Unselects: "All", "Favorites", "Out of Stock"
├── Clears: favoritesOnly filter
├── Preserves: All other modal filters
└── Shows: Only in-stock products

Out of Stock Filter Chip Selected:
├── Unselects: "All", "Favorites", "In Stock"
├── Clears: favoritesOnly filter
├── Preserves: All other modal filters
└── Shows: Only out-of-stock products
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **All Filter Chip**
```dart
selected: _filter.inStock == null && !_filter.favoritesOnly,
onSelected: (_) async {
  _filter = _filter.copyWith(
    inStock: null,           // Clear stock filter
    favoritesOnly: false,    // Clear favorites filter
  );
  // Other filters preserved automatically
}
```

### **Favorites Filter Chip**
```dart
selected: _filter.favoritesOnly,
onSelected: (isSelected) async {
  _filter = _filter.copyWith(
    favoritesOnly: isSelected,
    inStock: isSelected ? null : _filter.inStock,  // Clear stock when favorites selected
  );
}
```

### **Stock Filter Chips (In Stock / Out of Stock)**
```dart
onSelected: (isSelected) async {
  _filter = _filter.copyWith(
    inStock: isSelected ? true/false : null,
    favoritesOnly: isSelected ? false : _filter.favoritesOnly,  // Clear favorites when stock selected
  );
}
```

## 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Intuitive Behavior**
✅ **All**: "Show me everything that matches my other filters"  
✅ **Favorites**: "Show me only my favorites (regardless of stock status)"  
✅ **In Stock**: "Show me only available items (not just favorites)"  
✅ **Out of Stock**: "Show me only unavailable items (not just favorites)"  

### **Filter Preservation**
✅ **Price range**: Always preserved across filter chip changes  
✅ **Site selection**: Always preserved across filter chip changes  
✅ **Categories**: Always preserved across filter chip changes  
✅ **Search terms**: Always preserved across filter chip changes  
✅ **Other modal filters**: All preserved when switching between filter chips  

## 🔄 **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Using Price Filter + All**
1. User sets price range €10-50 in modal
2. User clicks "All" filter chip
3. **Result**: Shows all products €10-50 (both in-stock and out-of-stock)

### **Scenario 2: Using Site Filter + Favorites**
1. User selects "Ippodo" site in modal
2. User clicks "Favorites" filter chip
3. **Result**: Shows only favorite Ippodo products (both in-stock and out-of-stock)

### **Scenario 3: Using Category Filter + In Stock**
1. User selects "Matcha" category in modal
2. User clicks "In Stock" filter chip
3. **Result**: Shows only in-stock Matcha products (not limited to favorites)

## ✨ **Result**

The filter chips now work intuitively - they only control stock status and favorites, while preserving all other user-selected filters from the modal. This provides a much better user experience where users can combine detailed filtering (price, sites, categories) with quick stock status filtering without losing their filter settings!

The "All" filter truly shows "all" items according to the user's other criteria, making the filtering system more predictable and user-friendly. 🎯✨
