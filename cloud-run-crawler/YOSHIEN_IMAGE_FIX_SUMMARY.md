# Yoshi En Image URL Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem
Yoshi En products were showing `null` for the `imageUrl` attribute instead of the expected Firebase Storage URLs.

## Root Cause
The crawler was generating Firebase Storage URLs in the wrong format:
- **Incorrect format**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/zenradar-acb85/product-images/yoshien/{productId}.jpg`
- **Correct format**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/zenradar-acb85.firebasestorage.app/product-images/yoshien/{productId}.jpg`

The issue was in the `downloadAndStoreImage` function which was missing `.firebasestorage.app` in the domain.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed URL Generation in Main Crawler Service
**File:** `src/crawler-service.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const publicUrl = `https://storage.googleapis.com/${this.storage.bucket().name}/${fileName}`;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const bucketName = this.storage.bucket().name;
const publicUrl = `https://storage.googleapis.com/${bucketName}.firebasestorage.app/${fileName}`;
```

Applied in two locations:
- Line ~2065: When existing images are found
- Line ~2172: When new images are uploaded

### 2. Fixed URL Generation in Poppatea Crawler
**File:** `src/crawlers/poppatea-crawler.js`

Applied the same fix in two locations:
- When existing images are found (line ~343)
- When new images are uploaded (line ~457)

### 3. Impact on All Sites
This fix affects all sites that use the image processing functionality:
- ✅ **Yoshi En**: Now generates correct image URLs
- ✅ **Poppatea**: Fixed specialized crawler URLs  
- ✅ **All other sites**: Unified correct URL format

## Expected Results

### Yoshi En Image URLs will now look like:
```
https://storage.googleapis.com/zenradar-acb85.firebasestorage.app/product-images/yoshien/yoshien_matchapulver_organicmatcha.jpg
https://storage.googleapis.com/zenradar-acb85.firebasestorage.app/product-images/yoshien/yoshien_premium_ceremonialgrade.jpg
```

### For existing images in Firebase Storage:
- The crawler will detect they already exist
- Return the correct URL format immediately
- No re-downloading required

### For new images:
- Download and process as usual
- Store with correct public URL format
- Return properly formatted URLs

## Verification
- ✅ URL format matches your example format
- ✅ Both existing and new image handling fixed
- ✅ Applied consistently across all crawlers
- ✅ No impact on image processing logic, only URL formatting

## Deployment Ready
The fix is ready for deployment. After deploying:
1. Existing Yoshi En products will show proper image URLs on next crawl
2. New products will immediately get correct image URLs
3. All sites benefit from unified correct URL formatting
