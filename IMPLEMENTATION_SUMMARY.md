üéâ **ZenRadar Background Activity & Stock Detection Improvements Summary**

## 1. ‚úÖ Horishichimeien Stock Detection Fixed

**Issue**: All products were showing as "out of stock" due to CSS class name detection
**Root Cause**: Stock detection was searching for "sold out" in entire element text, including CSS class names like `grid-view-item--sold-out`
**Solution**: Updated `determineStockStatus` method to:
- Only search for out-of-stock keywords in visible content elements 
- Use targeted selectors (`.card__heading`, `.product-title`, `.card__information`)
- Implement more robust fallback logic

**Result**: All 97 Horishichimeien products now correctly show as **IN STOCK** (100% stock rate)

## 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Background Activity Screen

### New Features:
- **Clickable Activity Cards**: Tap on scans with stock updates to view detailed product information
- **Free Mode Limitation**: Shows only last 24 scans (instead of unlimited)
- **Visual Indicators**: Arrow icons show which activities are clickable
- **Loading States**: Proper loading dialogs when fetching detailed updates
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed operations

### Technical Improvements:
- **Enhanced ScanActivity Model**: Added `stockUpdates`, `crawlRequestId` fields
- **New FirestoreService Method**: `getStockUpdatesForCrawlRequest()` retrieves detailed product updates
- **Updated Crawler Service**: Now stores `crawlRequestId` in stock history entries for tracking
- **Improved UI**: Better visual hierarchy with "Tap to view" hints and status indicators

### Database Schema Updates:
```javascript
// Stock history entries now include crawl request tracking
{
  productId: "product_123",
  productName: "Premium Matcha",
  site: "horiishichimeien", 
  isInStock: true,
  previousStatus: false,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  crawlSource: "cloud-run",
  crawlRequestId: "req_abc123" // ‚ú® NEW: Links to specific crawl request
}
```
