# ZenRadar Enhanced Foreground Service Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the background service to use a robust foreground service implementation that's much harder for Android to kill, ensuring continuous matcha stock monitoring.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Service Configuration**
- **Multiple Service Types**: Added `dataSync|connectedDevice` for broader Android compatibility
- **Persistent Mode**: Service configured with `stopWithTask="false"` to survive app closure
- **Auto-restart**: Enhanced auto-start on boot capabilities

### 2. **Foreground Service Protection**
```dart
// Critical protection mechanisms:
- Immediate foreground mode activation
- Persistent heartbeat every 2 minutes
- Service health monitoring every 3 minutes
- Automatic foreground mode recovery
```

### 3. **Enhanced Monitoring & Recovery**
- **Heartbeat System**: Updates every 2 minutes with notification timestamps
- **Watchdog Mechanism**: Monitors service health every 3 minutes
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically restores foreground mode if lost
- **Health Reporting**: Logs service statistics every 30 minutes

### 4. **Improved Notifications**
- **Persistence Indicators**: Notifications show "Protected Service" status
- **Real-time Updates**: Live timestamps prove service is active
- **Status Tracking**: Shows scan progress, next check times, and service health

### 5. **Android Manifest Enhancements**
```xml
<service android:name="id.flutter.flutter_background_service.BackgroundService"
    android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync|connectedDevice"
    android:stopWithTask="false"
    android:enabled="true" />
```

## How It Works

### Service Lifecycle Protection
1. **Immediate Foreground**: Service immediately enters foreground mode on start
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Heartbeat ensures service stays alive
3. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatically restores foreground mode if lost
4. **Health Reporting**: Provides detailed logging for debugging

### Anti-Termination Strategies
- **Foreground Service**: Primary protection against battery optimization
- **Multiple Service Types**: Broader compatibility with Android versions
- **Persistent Notifications**: Required for foreground services
- **Watchdog Recovery**: Automatic restoration if service degrades

### Battery Optimization Handling
The app already has permissions for:
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
- `WAKE_LOCK`
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation
```
üíì Enhanced heartbeat: Service alive at 14:23
üõ°Ô∏è Watchdog active ‚Ä¢ Service healthy ‚Ä¢ Last check: 14:25
‚úÖ Scan complete ‚Ä¢ Next: 15:00 ‚Ä¢ Service Protected
```

### Recovery Scenarios
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Service not in foreground during scan - restoring
üö® CRITICAL: Service not in foreground mode - forcing restoration
‚úÖ Foreground service restored by watchdog
```

## User Benefits
1. **Reliable Monitoring**: Service much less likely to be killed by Android
2. **Better Notifications**: Clear indication when service is active and protected
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Service self-heals if Android tries to background it
4. **Debug Information**: Detailed logging helps troubleshoot any issues

## Troubleshooting

### If Service Still Gets Killed
1. **Check Battery Settings**: Ensure ZenRadar is excluded from battery optimization
2. **Review Logs**: Look for watchdog recovery messages
3. **Restart Service**: Manual restart will re-establish all protections
4. **Device Settings**: Some manufacturers have aggressive power management

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check service status
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep ZenRadar

# Monitor service notifications
adb shell cmd notification list

# Check battery optimization
adb shell dumpsys deviceidle whitelist
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components Enhanced
- `background_service.dart`: Core service logic with enhanced persistence
- `AndroidManifest.xml`: Updated service configuration
- Notification management with real-time status updates
- Heartbeat and watchdog systems for automatic recovery

### Performance Considerations
- Heartbeat every 2 minutes (minimal battery impact)
- Watchdog every 3 minutes (lightweight health checks)
- Efficient notification updates (only when status changes)
- Smart recovery mechanisms (only when needed)

This enhanced implementation provides the most robust foreground service possible within Android's constraints, significantly reducing the likelihood of service termination while maintaining efficient resource usage.
